Yes, in America, that's a very popular joke.
Do you have a mother-in-law joke?

127
00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.118
- Yes.
- <i>All right.</i>

128
00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:36.388

132
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.396
Uh, I don't think that Americans
would find that funny.

133
00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:49.565
No, it is not a joke.

134
00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:52.235
Yeah, we're talking about,
um, humor.

135
00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:54.710
Oh, yes, you asked me
about my mother-in-law.

136
00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.748
Do you have a joke
about your mother-in-law?

137
00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.908
No, why make a joke
on a mother-in-law?

138
00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:01.646
Um-

139
00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:05.485
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?

140
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.560
Here in America, we try not to...

141
00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:12.893
make fun of or be funny with things
that people don't choose.

142
00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.262
But perhaps you have not seen, um...

143
00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:18.700
someone with a very funny retardation.

144
00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:20.704
My brother Bilo...

145
00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:24.833
have a very funny, uh, retardation.

146
00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.208
Um, in mental retardation, you know...

147
00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:30.180
it causes a lot of pain and hardship
for a lot of families.

148
00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:33.012
Sometime my sister,
she show her vagine...

149
00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:35.952
to my brother, Bilo, and say...

150
00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:39.684
"You will never get this.
You will never get this. La-la-la-la-la."

151
00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.818
He, uh, behind his cage, crazy, crazy.
Everybody laugh.

152
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.953
She go, "You never get this."

153
00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:49.524
Uh, but one time he break cage
and he get this.

154
00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:52.229
And then we laugh. High five.

155
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.935
Now, um-

156
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:02.476
Um, no, that would not be funny
in America, okay?

157
00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:05.550
What is a "not" jokes?

158
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:09.382
<i>A "not" joke is when we're trying</i>
<i>to make fun of something...</i>

159
00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:13.857
and what we do is, we make a statement
that we pretend is true...

160
00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.520
but at the end, we say "not,"
which means it's not true.

161
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.097
So teach me how to make one.

162
00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:21.962
- All right. What color is your suit?
- This suit is gray.

163
00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.830
Gray. I would call it blue, okay?

164
00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:25.961
- It's gray.
- All right, it's blue-gray.

165
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.062
- But it's certainly not black, right?
- Well, it's more gray.

166
00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.905
- All right, let's say it's gray. But it's not-
- It is gray.

167
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:34.479
Okay, so a "not" joke, I would say...

168
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.208
"That suit is black. Not!"

169
00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:41.082
This-a suit is <i>not</i> black.

170
00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:44.020
- No, no, "not" has to be the end. Okay.
- Okay.

171
00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.353
This suit is black not.

172
00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:49.359
This suit is black. Pause.
You know what a pause is?

173
00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:52.191
- <i>Yes.</i>
- This suit is black. Not!

174
00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:55.495
This suit is black, pause, not.

175
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:58.161
No, you don't say "pause."

176
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.170
This suit is black.

177
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.572
That's a pause. Not!

178
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.576
This suit is black.

179
00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:09.811
Okay, um-

180
00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.940
- I don't- I don't- I'm not-
- Not!

181
00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.681
Everybody say U.S.A. television
much better...

182
00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.056
but this I watch for three hours,
do not change.

183
00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:24.425
<i>There's a remote control right here.</i>

184
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.725
You push these two arrows
to change the channel.

185
00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:32.196
<i>I got him! I got him!</i>

186
00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:35.671
Would you come out in the backyard with me?
I have the urge to bury something else.

187
00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.469
Yes!

188
00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:41.978
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too, Jamie.

189
00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.641
<i>Oh, I love you.</i>

190
00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.668
Do you believe in magic, um, miss-

191
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.670
Parker. C.J.

192
00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:09.138
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you, C.J.</i>

193
00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:16.407
<i>Be careful! Be careful, C.J...!</i>

194
00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:21.145
<i>This C.J. was like no Kazakh woman</i>
<i>I had ever seen.</i>

195
00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:23.687
<i>She had golden hairs...</i>

196
00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:26.519
<i>teeth as white as pearls...</i>

197
00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:30.288
<i>and the asshole of a seven-year-old.</i>

198
00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:32.990
<i>For the first time in my lifes...</i>

199
00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:35.293
<i>I was in love.</i>

200
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.341
Okay.

201
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:57.422
In Kazakhstan, it is illegal...

202
00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:00.356
for more than five woman
to be in the same place...

203
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:03.189
except for in brothel
or in grave.

204
00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:07.664
In U.S. and A., many womens
meet in a groups called feminists.

205
00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:11.133
I find-a more. <i>Chenquieh.</i>

206
00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:14.797
So what-a means, this "feminism"?

207
00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:19.367
<i>It's the theory that women</i>
<i>should be equal to men...</i>

208
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:23.141
<i>in matters economic-</i>

209
00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.216
- <i>social and political.</i>
- Now, you are laughing.

210
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.182
- Yeah.
- That is the problem.

211
00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:29.846
<i>Do you think a woman</i>
<i>should be educate?</i>

212
00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.855
Definitely.

213
00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:35.984
But is it not a problem that the woman
have a smaller brain than the men?

214
00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.495
That is wrong.

215
00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:41.395
But the government scientist, Dr. Yamak,
have prove it is size of squirrel.

216
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.333
- Your government scientist?
- Yes, Dr. Yamak.

217
00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:45.767
He's wrong. He's wrong.

218
00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:48.704
Give me a smile, baby. Why angry face?

219
00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:52.299
Well, what you're saying
is very demeaning.

220
00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.504
- Do you know the word "demeaning"?
- No.

221
00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:57.611
We are saying to you-

222
00:16:57.716 --> 00:17:01.152
<i>I could not concentrate</i>
<i>on what this old man was saying.</i>

223
00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:02.550
They should get paid-

224
00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:05.248
<i>All I could think about</i>
<i>was this lovely woman...</i>

225
00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.757
<i>in her red water panties.</i>

226
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.021
<i>Who was this C.J.?</i>

227
00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:13.064
Last night I see, in my hotel room...

228
00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:17.295
um, a woman called C.J. on television.

229
00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:19.394
- Do you know her?
- No.

230
00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:22.702
She-a from a town called Baywatches.

231
00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:25.606
- She's just on television.
- Her name is Pamela.

232
00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.110
Do she live here in New York City?

233
00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.736
- No, no, no.
- She lives in California.

234
00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.371
Oh, in California.

235
00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:32.575
- He's gonna look her up.
- Okay, are we finished now?

236
00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:34.652
Listen, pussycat, smile a bit.

237
00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:36.277
<i>All right. That's it.</i>

238
00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:38.481
- I'm done.
- Okay, we're finished. We have to leave.

239
00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:43.157
<i>Although I was obsessed by this C.J...</i>

240
00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:45.162
<i>I could not pursue her...</i>

241
00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:48.961
<i>or else my wife</i>
<i>would snap off my cock.</i>

242
00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:55.265
- Mr. Sagdiyev?
- Yes?

243
00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:57.342
Uh, I have a telegram for you.

244
00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:59.536
Uh, you can read?

245
00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.545
Yes, I can.

246
00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:04.138
Uh, it's "Dear Borat Sagdiyev...

247
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:07.241
"your wife, OK- Oksana...

248
00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:12.813
"was walking your retarded Bilo
in the woods...

249
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:16.554
"when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.

250
00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.289
She is now dead."

251
00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:22.333
Uh, you saying my wife is dead?

252
00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:25.028
This is what it-

253
00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:27.037
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

254
00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:32.609
Uh, yes, sir.

255
00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:37.614
I'm sorry to inform you,
but that's what the telegram says.

256
00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:40.014
High five. Great.

257
00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.546
<i>Eventually, I persuade Azamat...</i>

258
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:19.215
<i>that we would travel to California...</i>

259
00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:22.157
<i>and make our reportings</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

260
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.024
<i>He insist we not fly...</i>

261
00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:28.327
<i>in case the Jews repeated</i>
<i>their attack of 9/11.</i>

262
00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:35.703
My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your driving
instructor. Welcome to our country, okay?

263
00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.139
- My name-a Borat.
- Okay, okay. Good, good.

264
00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:40.211
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.

265
00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:45.250
- Now, you do know how to drive a little bit?
- Yes.

266
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.250
Yes. Put it in "D."

267
00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.217
- What?
- Drive.

268
00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:54.622
Now, wait a second. Wait a second.

269
00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.990
Have you driven a car before?

270
00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.563
- Yes, many times.
- Okay, all right. Let's go this way.

271
00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:01.895
Wait a minute. I don't want you
to go hitting anybody.

272
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.264
Use two hands, now.

273
00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:06.997
- What?
- Two hands.

274
00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:10.097
But then it look like I am holding
a gypsy while he eat my <i>khram</i>.

275
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.474
I don't care what it looks like.
You use two hands when you drive, okay?

276
00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.740
Okay.

277
00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.784
Okay.

278
00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.753
- Watch the children.
- Okay, no problem.

279
00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.982
You must not hit the children.

280
00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:29.083
Look, there is a woman in a car!

281
00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:31.822
Can we follow her and maybe
make a sexy time with her?

282
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.592
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Not yet, huh? Why not?

283
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.466
Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

284
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.629
- What?
- <i>How about that? Isn't that amazing?</i>

285
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.503
- You joke?
- There must be consent.

286
00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:46.601
How about that?
That's good, huh?

287
00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.942
- Is not good for me.
- <i>No, it is good.</i>

288
00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:51.106
- Steer the car.
- Okay.

289
00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:54.049
- Want to have a drink?
- You can't drink that while you're driving.

290
00:20:54.152 --> 00:20:56.814
- It's against the law.
- Why not? What?

291
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.651
Who is this car that follow us?
I wish it didn't follow us anymore.

292
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.251
- Oh, I don't know.
- Maybe we lose them.

293
00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:06.524
No, we better not lose them.

294
00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:09.658
- Hey, don't look at me. Eat my tits!
- All right.

295
00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.998
We'll make a right turn up here.

296
00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.902
- Don't look at me like that! I will eat your shit.
- Hey, don't do that.

297
00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.202
- You fuck my mother.
- Hey, hey. You can't do that.

298
00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:19.834
- No, he do before. He look on me.
- You can't do that, okay?

299
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:23.381
- They're gonna throw us in jail,
me with you. You can't-
- Why in a jail?

300
00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.712
He look on me- la-la-la- behind.

301
00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.284
<i>You can't say that.</i>

302
00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:30.287
- I like you. Do you like me?
- I do like you.

303
00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.381
- You are my friend?
- You're a nice young man, and I am your friend.

304
00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:36.427
- You will be my boyfriend.
- Well- I won't be your boyfriend.

305
00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:39.190
- Why not? You do not like me?
- I can be. It depends.

306
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.198
Boyfriend-yeah, I can.

307
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.166
<i>Great success.</i>

308
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:47.500
<i>Now time to make purchase</i>
<i>of motor cars.</i>

309
00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:52.043
<i>I want to have a car that attract</i>
<i>a woman with a shave down below.</i>

310
00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:55.170
Well, that would be
a Corvette or a Hummer.

311
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.908
We will try to help you out here.

312
00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:03.346
A man yesterday tell me
if I buy a car...

313
00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.719
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.

314
00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:07.724
He means a car that women will like.

315
00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:10.556
- Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, there's no magnet.

316
00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.596
That was just-
He means the vehicle.

317
00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:14.165
Women love the Hummers.

318
00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:16.734
- Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

319
00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.666
The vehicle itself will be a magnet.

320
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.102
If I give you good price...

321
00:22:21.206 --> 00:22:23.766
will you please put in pussy magnet?

322
00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:27.936
Yeah, but there's-there's no such thing
in this country as a- as a... magnet.

323
00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:31.709
If this car drive
into a group of gypsy...

324
00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:34.047
will there be any damage to the car?

325
00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:35.915
It depends on how hard
you hit them and all that.

326
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.683
- Hard.
- It's hard to s-Yeah, hard?

327
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.918
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
they could crack your windshield.

328
00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:45.224
How fast do I need to go
to guarantee I kill him?

329
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.230
Let me tell you something.

330
00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:49.857
With this vehicle here, probably doing
35, 40 miles an hour would do it.

331
00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:50.935
- Great.
- Okay.

332
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.834
- When I buy my wife-
- Mm-hmm.

333
00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:58.239
um, at the start, she was cook good...

334
00:22:58.343 --> 00:23:01.642
her vagine work well,
and she strong on plow.

335
00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:04.716
But after three years,
once she was 15...

336
00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:06.716
then she become weak.

337
00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:08.911
Her voice become-a deep.

It sounds like you
met somebody who is from...

381
00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:02.088
what is called in America
"the gay community."

382
00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:05.629
- What it mean, "gay," this word "gay"?
- Homosexual.

383
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.290
A homosexual? You mean-

384
00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:17.699
Are you telling me the man who tried
to put a rubber fist in my anus...

385
00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.709

386
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.878
<i>Even though my anus was broken...</i>

387
00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:31.820

<i>Now, one of the things that</i>

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.398
<i>We welcome you to the 38th annual...</i>

<i>Kroger Valleydale</i>
<i>Stampede Days Rodeo.</i>

454
00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:34.522
Of course, every picture
that we get back...

455
00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:39.626
from the terrorists or anything else,
the Muslims, they look like you-

456
00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:42.228
- black hair and a black mustache.
- Yes.

457
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.367
Shave that dadgum mustache off
so you're not so conspicuous...

458
00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:49.935
so you look like maybe
an Italian or something.

459
00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:52.414
- Yes.
- As far as when people are looking at you.

460
00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:55.315
I see a lot of people, and I think,
"There's a dadgum Muslim.

461
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.218
I wonder what kind of bomb
he's got strapped to him."

462
00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.518
- Yes.
- And you probably aren't a Muslim.

463
00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:02.183
Maybe that's not your religion.

464
00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:04.454
No, I'm a Kazakh. I follow the hawk.

465
00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:06.530
Yeah, but-but you look
like one of them.

466
00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:09.191
This thing gets over with,
and when we win it...

467
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.097
- and kick the butts over there-
- Yes.

468
00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:14.103
- All of them son of a bucks
hanging from the gallows.
- Yes!

469
00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.469
By that time you will
have proven yourself...

470
00:31:16.574 --> 00:31:18.474
and they'll understand,
you'll be accepted.

471
00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:19.702
- Take care.
- Thank you.

472
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:22.143
- I ain't gonna kiss you.
- Why not?

473
00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:25.842
The people that do the kissing over here
are the ones that float around like that.

474
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.942
- Oh, they all "la-la-la"?
- Yeah, stay away from them that kiss.

475
00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.953
- Okay.
- You don't want nobody kissing.

476
00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:34.218
In my country, they take them,
and they take them to jail and finish them.

477
00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:36.486
- Take 'em out and hang 'em.
- Yes.

478
00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:38.323
That's what we're trying
to get done here.

479
00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:39.896
- High five.
- Thank you.

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.000
<i>I was sad.</i>

501
00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:06.702
<i>The rodeo peoples did not like me.</i>

502
00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:09.211
<i>What if Pamela did not like me too?</i>

503
00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:12.214
<i>We needed something</i>
<i>to change our fortunes.</i>

504
00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:23.054
Do not fear me, gypsy.
All I want from you is your tears.

505
00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:26.790
Please give them to me,
or I will take them.

506
00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.798
I'm not a gypsy.

507
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.063
I'm a Midwestern farmer's daughter.
Americana.

508
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.071
<i>You have many treasures.</i>
<i>Who did you rob for this?</i>

509
00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:38.301
We didn't rob them.
They all came from inside the house.

510
00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.969
I will look on your treasures, gypsy.

511
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:43.877
Is this understood?
I will look on them.

512
00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.608
Please, do.

513
00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:50.578
Who is this lady you have shrunk?

514
00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:53.987
Was she the owner of this house
that you camp in front of?

515
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:56.788
No. There's a couple more child's dolls.

516
00:34:56.894 --> 00:35:00.022
Do not try shrink me, gypsy.
I serious.

517
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:02.599
- These are your spells?
- No.

518
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.691
There's a good one:
<i>The Millionaire Mindset.</i>

519
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.270
- There we go.
- Wa wa wee wa.

520
00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:10.636
- <i>Baywatch.</i>
- Baywatch?

521
00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.508
It mean she love me.

522
00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:24.782
- Azamat!
- Yeah?

523
00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.349
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

524
00:35:55.453 --> 00:35:59.389
Hey, you!
Hey, stop that goddamn van. Hey!

525
00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:04.692
Hey, baby, you want to go out?
You want to go out, honey?

526
00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.774
I need the direction
to California, please.

527
00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:21.003
- To California?
- You're a long way from home.

528
00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:23.580
Who you with, man?
Who you with? Who you with?

529
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:27.674
I with my friend Azamat Bagatov.
We travel across the country.

530
00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:29.753
Hold on. Slow down.
Don't be talking all that.

531
00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.049
- You got to be talking English around here.
- Who you with?

532
00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:34.989
You look like Michael Jackson, "Beat It."

533
00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:38.755
Man, you better get your-Aw!

534
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:42.697
I like you peoples.
Can you teach me how to dress?

535
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.893
How can I be like you?

536
00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:48.233
- You need to loosen up that belt,
let them jeans down.
- Pull them down?

537
00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:50.807
- Don't pull them down like you're gonna go-
- Like a ho?

538
00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:52.808
- No, no, no, no.
- Like this?

539
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:56.038
- Yeah, yeah.
- But don't show your Huggies though, man.

540
00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.978
<i>What the hell?</i>

541
00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:00.312
- Is that fishnet?
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

542
00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:02.079
These are my underpants.

543
00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:05.053
- What kind of music you listen to?
- I like very much Kokibuchuk.

544
00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.817
You know Kokibuchuk?

545
00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:11.056
No, no, no.

546
00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.234
Can you teach me speak like you?

547
00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:20.702
- What you trying to say?
- How you say, "How do you do?"

548
00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:21.999
What's up wit it?

549
00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.903
- What's that with it?
- Yeah.

550
00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:38.152
What's up with it, Vanilla Face?

551
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:41.316
Me and my homey Azamat
just parked our slab outside.

552
00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:42.983
Please.

553
00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:46.325
We're looking for somewhere
to post up our black asses for the night.

554
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.127
So, uh, bang, bang, skid, skid, nigga.

555
00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:52.168
We're just a couple of pimps, no hos.

556
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.238
- Sir, sir, you got to leave.
- Okay.

557
00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:57.307
Either leave now, or we're gonna call
the cops and we'll have you taken out.

558
00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:12.746
- Hi.
- Thank you. You have room for tonight?

559
00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:14.518
- Oh, yes. Definitely.
- Yes.

560
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.183
- Come on in.
- Great.

561
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.228
- So, come on in.
- Come on in.

562
00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:19.990

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.799
- Oh, is beautiful houses.
- All the paint-

564
00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:26.995
All the paintings in the house I did.

565
00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:29.231
<i>What is this man?</i>

566
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.037
This is a Yemenite Jew,
and he's working on a piece of jewelry.

567
00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:36.113
The Yemenites-

568
00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:38.647
were also jewelers.

569
00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:41.217
Why you have a picture of a Jew?

570
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.219
Because I'm Jewish...

571
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:47.485
<i>so I have lots of pictures of Jews.</i>

572
00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:54.563
<i>Um, this is the room.</i>

573
00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:59.193
And, uh, do you need two pillows?

574
00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.930
Uh, yes.

575
00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:03.233
Great. Thank you. Lovely place.

576
00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:15.611
Aah!

577
00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:20.355
Shh!

578
00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.526
Um- Um-

579
00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:27.722
- <i>Wait, wait.</i>
- Okay.

580
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.665
Oh, hello.

581
00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.862
- How are you?
- Great.

582
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:35.996
You getting settled in?

583
00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:39.235
This is a special sandwich for you.

584
00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:41.072
- I, uh, not so hungry.
- Thank you.

585
00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.373
He can eat this.

586
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.778
He, uh, fat.

587
00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:47.248
No, no, thank you.

588
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:49.012
- You better eat because-
- Take a half.

589
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.485
- You take a half.
- Take a half.

590
00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:53.557
- Just a half, and then you'll see.
- Uh, I not so hungry.

591
00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:56.285
Yeah, yeah, eat a little bit.

592
00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.724
Go ahead and eat something because
you're hungry, and you're a guest.

593
00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.733
Yes.

594
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.605
I don't want to see you go hungry.

595
00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:18.514
What is this picture over here?

596
00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:19.844
Okay.

597
00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.218
It is 3:00 in the morning.

598
00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:32.056
I am in the nest of Jews.

599
00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:34.791
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

600
00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:39.598
One of them has taken the form
of a little old woman.

601
00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:42.365
You can barely see her horns.

602
00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:46.601
She have tried to poison me already.

603
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.678
These rats are very clever.

604
00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:54.513
What is that? What?

605
00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.953
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

606
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:47.733
What is the best gun
to defend from a Jew?

607
00:41:50.207 --> 00:41:54.576
I would, uh, recommend either
a nine-millimeter or a .45.

608
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.748
Very nice.

609
00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.783
Wa wa woo wa.

610
00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:04.946
It like I, uh, movie star, Dirty Harold.

611
00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:08.855
- Yes, sir.
- Come on and make my day, Jew.

612
00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:14.127
<i>But he would not sell me gun</i>
<i>since I'm not American.</i>

613
00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:16.358
<i>So I look for other protection.</i>

614
00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:22.704
- What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

615
00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:26.298
<i>Is this a cat in a hat?</i>

616
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.674
- No.
- No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

617
00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:29.973
Yes.

618
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.106
I need animal for protection.

619
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.117
What you have for me?

620
00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:07.073
High five! Great. Nice.

621
00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:42.279
<i>Happy times.</i>

622
00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:45.014
<i>We were safe</i>
<i>and well on our way to Pamela.</i>

623
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.818
<i>It was time to get back to work.</i>

624
00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:08.208
Hello. Nice meet you.

625
00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:11.645
Hello. It's so nice to meet you.
Welcome to America.

626
00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:17.244
Will you please teach me
how to dine like gentleman?

627
00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:19.481
Of course. I'll be happy to.

628
00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:25.792
<i>Is it polite to greet people</i>
<i>when I make entry?</i>

629
00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:28.023
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

630
00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:30.498
- Let me introduce you... around.
- Yes.

631
00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:33.092
- You're gonna have to say names.
- I'm Mike. Mike Jerrod.

632
00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:37.870
Hello. I'm Bethany Weston.

633
00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:40.409
- It's lovely to see you.
- Yes. How do you do?

634
00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.638
How do you do?
My name is Ben.

635
00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:46.840
Should I pay interest...

636
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.545
in peoples around the table sides?

637
00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:51.951
Yes.

638
00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:55.685
And if it is a big table,
a very long table...

639
00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:58.091
you might want to restrict
your conversation-

640
00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:00.925
- Yes.
- to people right in your vicinity.

641
00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:04.194
- Very nice.
- So you are not yelling.

642
00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.968
What do you do?

643
00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:11.632
I'm the pastor of a church.

644
00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:14.074
<i>Yes. What do you do?</i>

645
00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.703
<i>I have spent years in construction.</i>

646
00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:20.045
Um, I've recently retired.

647
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.482
- You are retard?
- Uh, yes. And now-

648
00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:26.613
- Uh, physical or mental?
- <i>Retired.</i>

649
00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:28.385
- Retired.
- No, no, not retard-

650
00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:30.221
Um, I don't work anymore.

651
00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.760
- Stopped working.
- Stopped working.

652
00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:35.127
Is very good you allow...

653
00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:38.292
a retard to eat with you...

654
00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:40.336
in the same place.

655
00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:42.496
<i>That's not what</i>
<i>we're saying about this man.</i>

656
00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:45.439
He is not what you would...

657
00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.339
re- refer to as retard.

658
00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.275
- <i>No.</i>
- No.

659
00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:51.609
No, no, not at all.

660
00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:53.774
Do you have a telephone
in this village?

661
00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.078
- Um-
- <i>Of course.</i>

662
00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.750
Should I show photos of my family?

663
00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:07.831
You have photos of your family?
Wonderful.

664
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.898
Uh, this my favorite son,
Hooeylewis.

665
00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:14.300
- Okay.
- <i>Yes.</i>

666
00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:16.133
- He looks happy.
- <i>Yes.</i>

667
00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.706
He very strong.

668
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.370
My goodness.
Is that him holding you?

669
00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:24.379
- Yes. Very strong.
- Goodness.

670
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:28.110
<i>He grow-a three centimeter.</i>
<i>He now 17 centimeter long.</i>

671
00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:29.651
Oh, okay.

672
00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.880
I'm not sure I would show...

673
00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.549
these photos of him
without clothes on.

674
00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:38.958
Should I pay compliments
to the peoples?

675
00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:41.690
Yes, but only if...

676
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:44.393
you truly agree with that compliment.

677
00:46:44.501 --> 00:46:48.460
You have very gentle face...

678
00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:51.700
and a very erotic physique.

679
00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:53.709
- Thank you.
- <i>You're correct.</i>

680
00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:56.575
That's a very good observation.

681
00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.138
- She is your wife?
- No, that's my wife.

682
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.150
<i>In my country...</i>

683
00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:05.415
they would go crazy-

684
00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:06.682
for these two.

685
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.052
Not so much-

686
00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.061
<i>Wa wa wee wa.</i>

687
00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:15.791
What should I say...

688
00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:18.732
if I need to go to the shithole?

689
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.997
Uh, you mean to the restroom?

690
00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:23.572
- To the place to make the shit.
- The bathroom.

691
00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.574
- Okay. What you-
- Not a bath-

692
00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.576
- To make dirt from anus.
- Not a bath, right.

693
00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.441
- The brown-
- The toilet.

694
00:47:29.546 --> 00:47:31.537
- Where you make, uh-You understand?
- Yes.

695
00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.947
- Bad- Bad- Bad thing from it.
- Yes. Yes.

696
00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:37.748
- Uh, what you do is you say-
- Brown.

697
00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:41.188
"Excuse me.
I need to go to the restroom."

698
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.259
Excuse me.

699
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.262
Is it possible to go and do a-you-

700
00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:49.559
- <i>To be excused?</i>
- How you say in the, you know-

701
00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:53.067
- Upstairs. Just say, "Excuse me a moment."
- How you say it?

702
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.070
- I need to do, uh-
- That works. Thank you.

703
00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:57.140
- What you say in-
- <i>You go upstairs.</i>

704
00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.708
Yes. Thank you.

705
00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:02.677
<i>I think that the cultural differences...</i>

706
00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:05.373
are vast.

707
00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:07.950
- Exactly.
- And I think he's a delightful man.

708
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:11.020
And it wouldn't take very much time...

709
00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:14.955
for him to really become Americanized.

710
00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.754
Thank you very much. I feel much better.
Cindy, where shall I put this?

711
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:20.659
- Just, uh-
- Where shall I put this?

712
00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:24.825
Oh, um-

713
00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:27.836
<i>Maybe in the other-</i>
<i>in the other room for a minute.</i>

714
00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.428
- <i>In... the-</i>
- In the-

715
00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:33.600
- I do not want the-
- Excuse me. Excuse me for just a moment, please.

716
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:37.146
You roll off... like this...

717
00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:39.215
and you wipe your bottom...

718
00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:40.908
and you put the paper- Look!

719
00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:43.486
- I-You wipe mine?
- You! No, I don't. You do.

720
00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.555
This is a very private thing.

721
00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:47.681
The host cleans the anus of the other?

722
00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.486
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:51.925
Nobody touches you except you.

724
00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:55.157
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

725
00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:58.757
If you have been invited
to a home or to a party-

726
00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:00.200
Yes.

727
00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:02.568
uh, it is acceptable
to bring a guest...

728
00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:05.972
- if you ask your host in advance.
- Yes.

729
00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:08.101
Well, Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee.

730
00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:09.769
Oh, wait. It is my friend.

731
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.781
- Hello?
- Hi. I'm looking for Borat.

732
00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:14.976
- Yes, is me. Yeah.
- Oh, hi, honey.

733
00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.950
- I'm Luenell.
- Oh, hello.

734
00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:18.954
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

735
00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:21.286
- This my friend Luenell.
- Hi.

736
00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:23.518
Oh, okay. Um-

737
00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:27.495
<i>Mm, mm. Y'all having a dinner party.</i>

738
00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:31.226
Well, we were. I-I don't know
exactly what all that we're doing.

739
00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.235
It is getting very, very late.

740
00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:35.601
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm gonna have to go home.

741
00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:38.334
- Okay. Very nice.
- It's getting very, very late.

742
00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:41.434
And it's- it's time
that the, uh, you know...

743
00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:45.072
- that we were ending our dinner party.
- <i>Oh.</i>

744
00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:48.083
- I apologi-
- But can she come for desserts?

745
00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:50.710
Absolutely not, and neither can you.

746
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.948
<i>The sheriff is on his way.</i>
<i>The police are coming now.</i>

747
00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.047
- <i>I hope so. Thank you.</i>
- <i>I've already called the police.</i>

748
00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:58.389
<i>Why you call police?</i>
<i>Have the retard escaped?</i>

749
00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:03.126
I want say I very sorry...

750
00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:05.224
how they treat you in this house.

751
00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:06.700
<i>Thank you.</i>

752
00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:08.737
<i>I was thinking maybe I'd just...</i>

753
00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:10.670
take the night off and-

754
00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.708
Why don't we just go out
and have some fun?

755
00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:14.743
<i>What do you think about that?</i>

756
00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:32.094
- Hi. My name Borat.
- How you doing?

757
00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:34.095
- This my friend Luenell.
- Hi, Luenell.

758
00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.791
- She is a prostitute.
- Oh!

759
00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:41.034
Oh!

760
00:50:54.317 --> 00:50:56.717
You were funny on those bulls.

761
00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.516
Everybody almost see your underpants.

762
00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:01.614
I never rode a bull before.

763
00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.718
Um-

764
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:08.821
Well, you want to-you want to
come in for a little while?

765
00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:12.959
I would like very much...

766
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.198
but I in love
with a woman in Malibu.

767
00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:19.298
It would not be nice to her
for me to-

768
00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:21.809
Okay, well,
if you're ever in town again...

769
00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.846
this way, you know, look me up.

770
00:51:23.947 --> 00:51:26.882
If I ever in town again, Luenell...

771
00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:29.451
I would very much like
to pay you for sex.

772
00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:30.713
Okay.

773
00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:34.120
Good night, Luenells.

774
00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:36.624
Good night, Borat.

775
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.060
You say my name right. Borat.

776
00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:50.003
People say Borak or Billy or Bob.

777
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.441
Bye.

778
00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:07.785
<i>"Pamela is a fairly simple girl.</i>

779
00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:10.155
"She recently explained...

780
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.160
"'There's not a whole lot of logic...

781
00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:14.822
"'in the way I live my life.

782
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:17.559
I am very spontaneous."'

783
00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.635
I'm very spontaneous too.

784
00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:42.214
<i>I needed a gift to give to Pamela...</i>

785
00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:46.091
<i>so that she would grant me entry</i>
<i>into her vagine.</i>

786
00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:48.426
<i>Therefore, I convinced Azamat...</i>

787
00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:52.730
<i>to let me film a report</i>
<i>in an American store.</i>

788
00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:00.507
<i>Uh, this your shops?</i>

789
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.077
Right. This is my antique shop.

790
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:05.512
<i>Why do you have so many things with a flag?</i>

791
00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:07.845
<i>We're honoring our heritage.</i>

792
00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:12.081
And what, uh, in here?
What is this?

793
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:14.157
These are a number of collectibles.

794
00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:17.920
I mean, this is a- this is a lamp that,
you know, you would use in your home.

795
00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:20.861
This is a Chinese cloisonné bell.

796
00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:25.367
And this is a-just a, uh-
a little decorative duck.

797
00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:28.596
And do you think, um,
you know, when they-

798
00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:35.111
I'm sorry. Wait. Wait.

799
00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:41.480
- <i>We need help, baby.</i>
- <i>No, it's okay.</i>

800
00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:46.712
I sorry.

801
00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:53.260
Sorry. I will, uh, repair all of this.

802
00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:55.490
<i>Don't worry.</i>

803
00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:58.090
My friend, he can make glue.

804
00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:00.601
I don't think you're gonna be able
to glue that stuff back.

805
00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:03.264
I think you're gonna have to pay for it.

806
00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:06.001
Okay, I have digital watch from future.
I will give you.

807
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.770
Is worth more than all of this.

808
00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:10.778
You broke $425 worth of stuff.

809
00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.976
160, 170, 180.

810
00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:17.110
That's not enough.

811
00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.120
Do you want hair?
This is very good-

812
00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:20.849
No, I don't want any damn hair.

813
00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:23.152
This is the best hair in Kazakhstan.
Feel the quality.

814
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.785
- I don't want your damn hair. We don't-
- This hair from pubis.

815
00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:28.227
I can get you, uh, 2,000 bags
by next Friday.

816
00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:30.458
We don't use that stuff in this country.

817
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.766
Just give me another 20.
That's good enough.

818
00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:44.646
Would you have believed this
if I had told you?

819
00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:48.047
- All right, go! Go! Go!
- Okay?

820
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.934
Oh! Holy sheeze. Ow.

821
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.165
Okay. Um-

822
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:24.934
Um-

823
00:57:47.464 --> 00:57:51.127
We have a special guest here this evening.
Uh, Ruth Feiner is here.

824
00:58:08.184 --> 00:58:11.347
What are you doing? Come on. Cut it out!

825
00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:19.322
- Just walk 'em out.
- Get the fuck out of here!

826
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:33.096
So, um, bad news.

827
00:58:33.206 --> 00:58:36.767
Azamat have, uh, leave.

828
00:58:36.876 --> 00:58:39.276
I wake up, he disappear...

829
00:58:39.379 --> 00:58:43.509
and he take... Oksana...

830
00:58:43.616 --> 00:58:46.949
my bear- our bear.

831
00:58:47.053 --> 00:58:50.022
And he also decide to take all money...

832
00:58:50.123 --> 00:58:52.250
and also my passport.

833
00:58:56.229 --> 00:58:58.527
And, um...

834
00:58:58.631 --> 00:59:00.531
he leave me...

835
00:59:01.568 --> 00:59:04.196
only this bag...

836
00:59:04.304 --> 00:59:06.272
with a hen...

837
00:59:07.974 --> 00:59:09.874
and, uh...

838
00:59:11.244 --> 00:59:14.145
ticket to Kazakhstan...

839
00:59:15.348 --> 00:59:17.316
but no passport.

840
00:59:19.285 --> 00:59:21.412

Make it without Azamat.

847
00:59:53.686 --> 00:59:57.713
I think will be better,
and I will have more success...

848
00:59:57.824 --> 00:59:59.724
without him.

849
01:00:00.793 --> 01:00:02.693

906
01:03:42.482 --> 01:03:45.474
There-Yes, it would be a better country.
We should have slaves.

907
01:03:45.585 --> 01:03:49.248
Our country, the minorities
actually have more power.

908
01:03:49.355 --> 01:03:53.416
Anyone that is minority
has the-the, uh, upper hand.

909
01:03:53.526 --> 01:03:57.860
We have the Jews. We have anybody
that's against the mainstream.

I will take her virgin

01:04:34.133 --> 01:04:36.465
- She's sucking some dick, man.
- <i>Do you see her sucking dick?</i>

925
01:04:36.569 --> 01:04:38.628
This is not her.

926
01:04:38.738 --> 01:04:42.139
I guarantee that that shit's gonna happen.
Don't worry about it.

927
01:04:42.241 --> 01:04:44.141
<i>That's her, Borak. Sorry.</i>

928
01:04:44.243 --> 01:04:47.076

- Come on, Boris.

935
01:04:59.892 --> 01:05:02.292
- Stay with us, buddy. Boris, stay strong.
- We love you.

936
01:05:02.395 --> 01:05:04.295
- We'll remember you always.

937
01:05:04.397 --> 01:05:06.661

You'll make it.
You keep going, okay?

940
01:05:11.938 --> 01:05:13.838

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.840
- You are better than a woman.
- I go back to New York.

942
01:05:15.942 --> 01:05:17.910
We will always be behind you.

943
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.911
Do not let a woman ever, ever...

944
01:05:21.013 --> 01:05:22.913
make you who you are.

945
01:05:23.015 --> 01:05:25.313
- Good-bye, my friends.
- Good-bye.

946
01:06:04.123 --> 01:06:05.715

947
01:06:23.409 --> 01:06:26.003
I sorry, my friend.

01:06:36.455 --> 01:06:39.151
Go.

950
01:06:39.258 --> 01:06:40.850
Run to freedom.

Go! Go! Live your life!

952
01:07:31.977 --> 01:07:34.377

Come on!

954
01:07:40.086 --> 01:07:41.815
It is good to be here.

955
01:07:41.921 --> 01:07:45.948
This is my 10th Pentecostal
camp meeting- a decade.

956
01:07:48.427 --> 01:07:50.054
<i>The bottom line is:</i>

957
01:07:50.162 --> 01:07:52.528
we are a Christian nation now...

958
01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:54.599
we were a Christian nation
in the beginning...

959
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.565
<i>and we're gonna always be</i>
<i>a Christian nation...</i>

960
01:07:56.669 --> 01:07:58.398
until the good Lord returns.

961
01:07:58.504 --> 01:07:59.596
<i>Amen.</i>

962
01:08:01.941 --> 01:08:04.273
I didn't evolve out of a monkey.

963
01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:07.470
I didn't used to be a tadpole.
I is what I is.

964
01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.480
Praise you, Jesus.

965
01:08:09.582 --> 01:08:12.608
<i>The Bible says that God</i>
<i>was manifest in the flesh...</i>

966
01:08:12.718 --> 01:08:15.653
<i>and believed all in the world!</i>

967
01:08:15.755 --> 01:08:19.213
I got good news:
Jesus is God in the flesh!

968
01:08:26.732 --> 01:08:29.724
I don't care what the devil's done to you
or what he's trying to do.

969
01:08:29.835 --> 01:08:32.065
All you gotta do is step out
of that aisle now...

970
01:08:32.171 --> 01:08:34.002
and make your way
down to this altar.

971
01:08:34.106 --> 01:08:37.041
<i>Let's have a little</i>
<i>old-time church right now.</i>

972
01:08:37.143 --> 01:08:39.941
I need somebody to pray with me
right now. Come on, sir!

973
01:08:40.045 --> 01:08:43.879
The blood over my neighbor!
I bleed the blood over my church!

974
01:08:47.086 --> 01:08:49.452
I want you to help save me, please.

975
01:08:49.555 --> 01:08:52.786
Ladies and gentlemen,

978
01:08:58.464 --> 01:09:00.056
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

979
01:09:02.735 --> 01:09:06.193
I have no friends.
I am alone in this country.

980
01:09:06.305 --> 01:09:07.932
Nobody like me.

981
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.940

987
01:09:26.458 --> 01:09:28.926
Is there anybody who can help me?

988
01:09:29.028 --> 01:09:30.393

989
01:09:30.496 --> 01:09:33.522

He loves your brother Bilo.

996
01:09:48.414 --> 01:09:51.975
Do Jesus love my neighbor

Can Jesus heal the pain
that is in my heart?

1000
01:10:02.661 --> 01:10:05.186
<i>Jesus can heal your pain in your heart!</i>
